	<p>My name is Richard Holgate, and this is my person website. I recently 
	graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Portland State University.
	 I am currently looking for a software engineering job - I have a love for
	 Web Development and Object Oriented Programming in Java and C++. In my 
	free time I like to tinker with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, develop 
	programming projects, practice my drawing, and play video games.</p>

	<p>I'm glad to have you visiting. I suggest checking out my coding projects
	 and other projects pages, or if you want to see some fun, check out my 
	testing area. Feel free to visit the About page for contact information, and
	my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.</p>
