	<p>I'm Richard Holgate, I'm a programmer, and all around geeke. I recently graduated with my Computer Science
		degree from Portland State University, and am currently spending my free time developing this site,
	       	working on other programming projects, reading lots, and teaching grade school kids how to program
		through a program called Code To The Future. </p>
	<p>This site is somewhere for me to share what I know, and keep record of what I'm working on. I've found
		that writing about what I work on helps me learn more deeply, keep track of what I've done, and gives
		me something to show people when they ask what I like to do. Most of what I do, and most of what I
		write about is programming, but I have several other hobbies as well. I enjoy doing a bit of drawing,
		writing short fiction, graphic design, DM'ing D&amp;D games, and listening to Hip-Hop. I've always
		enjoyed the act of creating - developing worlds of my imagining, sketching designs and illustrations,
		telling stories however I can - and programming has always been a natural extension of that.</p>
	<p>I started out programming in middle school, learning to use flash 8 and actionscript 2, and some basic
		html and css. I kept that up through highschool, and eventually started school at the University
		of British Columbia pursuing a Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science. I've always had a passion
		for the more artistic elements of programming, and the option of a B.A. intrigued me. However, after 
		two years in Vancouver B.C. I decided that it wasn't the place for me. I found my classmates were
		often more interested in how lucrative their future career could be, than their passion for the
		subject. I transferred to Portland State University, where I found that passion I was looking for;
		I made a great group of friends who all loved what they were doing. There I developed a passion
		for Object Oriented Programming in C++ and Java, and focused my elective classes on UI and UX
		design, and web development. I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science in June,
		and am currently looking for enmployment. </p>
